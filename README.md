# CommunityFridge_REST_API_Arunteja
A REST API for a Community Fridge management system, using Node.js, JavaScript, Express and MongoDB.    

The config.js file is updated with the relevant information to connect to the MongoDB cluster.

The Assignment4_MongoDB_URL_Arunteja.txt file contains information used in the config.js file, I've included this for your reference if needed.

The fridge-router.js file contains the routes used by the express application. I have commented out the route (which was included in the starter code) 
on line 31 in this file as it is not necessary and as it uses the underlying json data, which is not allowed.

The server.js file contains more routes used by the express application and has the included starter code to connect to the MongoDB database

The 3 model files which were included in the starter code; fridgeModel.js, itemModel.js and typeModel.js are in the "models" subfolder. 

The data subfolder contains the json data only used by the application to initialize the MongoDB database, after which all data manipulation is done on data  
in the MongoDB database.



Any relevant instructions for running your code:
None
